<h1>Hey I'm Andy Cernera</h1>
<h2>Look at how smart I am</h2>

<p>I am a data engineer at Omada Health. I primarily work with our reporting infrastructure and ETL pipeline. We use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Rails</li>
  <li>Postgres <3</li>
</ul>

<p>In my free time I work on some side projects:</p>

<h2><a href="http://stayhome.co">StayHome</a></h2>

<img src="images/stayhome2.png" height="300px" alt="">
<p>
  A site to track all of your TV watching. It's built with React/Redux/React-Router on the front end. Rails/Postgres on the back end.
  <br>
  Feel free to try it out with a test account. (u: test@test.com, p: stayhomeapp)
</p>

<h2><a href="https://andy-pong.herokuapp.com">Andy Pong</a></h2>
<img src="images/andypong.png" height="300px" alt="">
<p>
  A site to track my office's ping pong matches. It's built in Rails/Postgres. There is also a Slack integration for easy match tracking.<br>
  (I'm trusting you to not mess anything up. There is no auth for tracking. Don't be evil.)
</p>

<h2>AndyBucks</h2>
<img src="images/andybucks.png" alt="">
<p>
  My own personal currency backed by Bitcoin. Each AndyBuck has its own address on the blockchain containing $1 worth of Bitcoin (at the time of printing).
  <br><br>
  A QR code representing the public key associated with the address is printed on the front. The private key is printed underneath a scratch off adhesive so that you can 'redeem' your Bitcoin at any time.
  <br><br>
  (I've since taken it down because I'm not maintaining it)
  <br><br>
  Technologies used:
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby - made a gem for Buck generation</li>
    <li>Rails</li>
    <li>Postgres</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>This is how often I code outside of work:</p>

<p>Don't read too far into that.</p>

<h3>I do comedy things too.</h3>
